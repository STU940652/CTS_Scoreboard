# CTS_Scoreboard
HTML display of CTS scoreboard.

This is a command line utility to snoop the serial link between a Colorado Timing Systems controller and scoreboard. It will then render the scoreboard to HTML using Javascript and a Websocket connection. Example use cases are creating an overlay for video streaming using OBS studio, secondary scoreboard, or scoreboard replacement.

# Hardware
To get the CTS serial stream, you need:
1) An RS-232 port, e.g. a USB to RS-232 cable.
2) A mono 1/4" male to two female Y cable
